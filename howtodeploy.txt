# How to Deploy Tetris (One-File Executable)

## Windows (PC) - One-File EXE

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.
2. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install PyInstaller:
   pip install pyinstaller
4. Open a terminal in the project root.
5. Run the following command:
   set PYTHONPATH=src && pyinstaller --onefile --name Tetris src/main.py
6. The single EXE will be in the dist/ folder as Tetris.exe.
7. Double-click Tetris.exe to play!

## Android (APK) - One-File App

- Use Kivy and Buildozer (Python to APK):
  1. Install Kivy and Buildozer (see https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-android.html)
  2. Adapt main.py to use Kivy's App class and touch controls.
  3. Run: buildozer init
  4. Edit buildozer.spec (set requirements: pygame, etc.)
  5. Run: buildozer -v android debug
  6. APK will be in bin/ folder. Install on your device.

## iOS (IPA) - One-File App

- Use Kivy and Xcode (Python to IPA):
  1. Install Kivy and Xcode (see https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-ios.html)
  2. Adapt main.py to use Kivy's App class and touch controls.
  3. Use toolchain to build:
     toolchain create Tetris src/main.py
     toolchain build Tetris
     toolchain install Tetris
  4. Archive and export IPA via Xcode.

## Notes
- For best results, use the provided resources in src/tetris/resources/.
- For Android/iOS, you may need to adapt input (touch controls) and screen size.
- For Windows, everything is bundled in one EXE, just double-click to play.
